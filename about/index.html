        		<h1>About us</h1>
				<p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an emerging field of study and has proved its power and applicability in lot of fields, e.g., gaming, machine translation, robotic, etc. We are a research group at Industrial Engineering Department of <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/ise/"> Lehigh University</a> and research on RL algorithms in order to used them in supply chain problems. Here we presents our findings on beer game project and share ideas and new findings as much as we can. 
				<p> This group is supervised by professor <a href="http://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/larry/">Larry Snyder</a> and professor <a href="http://mtakac.com/">Martin Takac</a>. Currently, <a href="http://oroojlooy.github.io/">Afshin Oroojlooy</a> and Reza Nazari, who are studying their PhD are working on this project.
